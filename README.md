An experimental voice satellite software for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) remote voice control and interaction.

This project enables you to build a Linux-based voice assistant designed to use [Assist](https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/) for Home Assistant. It allows you to create your own smart speaker that runs on any x64 or ARM64 hardware capable of handling local audio processing (using PulseAudio).

Unlike simpler voice satellites that run on microcontrollers with very limited compute power, this setup can perform local wake word detection (OWW/MWW) and process some data on-device.

Because it runs on a full Linux system and offers access significantly more local computing resources for additional features and other integrations on the same satellite, this approach also provides greater flexibility for customization (such as for example experiment with using PipeWire).

## Features

- Works with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/esphome/) using the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) protocol/API (via [aioesphomeapi](https://github.com/esphome/aioesphomeapi))
- Feature local on-device wake word detection using integrated [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord) or [MicroWakeWord](https://github.com/kahrendt/microWakeWord)
- Supports multiple wake words and languages
- Supports multiple architectures (linux/amd64 and linux/aarch64)
- Automated builds with artifact attestation for security
- Supports [announcments](https://www.home-assistant.io/actions/assist_satellite.announce/), [start](https://www.home-assistant.io/actions/assist_satellite.start_conversation/)/continue conversation, and timers
- Tested and works with Python 3.11 and Python 3.13.
- Prebuild docker image available on [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/linux-voice-assistant/pkgs/container/linux-voice-assistant)
- Prebuild [Raspberry Pi image](https://github.com/florian-asche/PiCompose)
- Supports [Websocket API](./docs/peripheral_api.md) for peripherals (e.g. buttons, LEDs, etc.) to integrate with the voice assistant

## Requirements

- **Microphone:** Device must support 16kHz mono audio
- **CPU:** 1Ghz
- **Memory:** min. 512MB
- **Storage:** The OS and software is around 4GB
- **OS:** linux/amd64 or linux/aarch64

A more extensive list for possible compatible hardware can be found in the [PiCompose documentation](https://github.com/florian-asche/PiCompose) but basically any microphone that works with [PipeWire (multimedia framework for Linux)](https://pipewire.org/) can in theory be used for voice input with the prebuild image from there, you should however preferably use a far-field microphone-array solution if want better result.

Two solutions recommended for setups today is:

- use a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (Single Board Computer with built-in WiFi) in combination with the [Satellite1 Hat Board](https://futureproofhomes.net/products/satellite1-top-microphone-board)
- use at least a Raspberry Pi 3 with the [Respeaker Lite](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/reSpeaker_usb_v3/). The Respeaker Lite currently has a problem with the Zero 2W.

Those mic-boards have microphone-array designed for far-field voice capture with the added benefit of using an onboard XMOS DSP microcontroller with custom firmware which does advanced audio pre-processing for microphone cleanup that result in very good voice recognition capabilities (as it runs algorithms for Noise Suppression, Acoustic Echo Cancellation, Interference Cancellation, and Automatic Gain Control).

Alternatively if on a lower budget then suggest could use other microphone-array boards like for example the [reSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT V2.0](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/) (which uses a much more basic audio codec chip).

## Usage

### Installation

**Assist Satellite app for Home Assistant OS**

For HA OS, we provide a finished [Assist Satellite](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/apps/tree/main/assist_satellite) app (formerly add-on), which uses the Linux Voice Assistant runtime to turn your HA host into a voice satellite. 

> [!NOTE]
> For now you first have to add the [OHF-Voice apps](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/apps) repo manually to the App Store repository inside Home Assistant before you can install it.

Later you will be able to install it directly from the official add-on repository (but it is not yet published publicly there):

[![Add repository to your Home Assistant instance.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/home-assistant/addons)

Once installed, the satellite is automatically discovered by Home Assistant via the ESPHome integration.

**Raspberry Pi prebuilt image**

For Raspberry Pi users, we provide a prebuild image that can be flashed to a SD card. See [PiCompose](https://github.com/florian-asche/PiCompose).

**Docker / bare metal**

For all other users, we have different installation methods available (Docker, systemd), each with its own dedicated instructions. See [Linux-Voice-Assistant - Installation](docs/install.md). 

### Parameter overview

💡 **Note:** There is an [environment variable](docs/install_application.md#environment-variables-reference) for each parameter if you use docker or systemd based setup.

💡 **Note:** There are detailed explanations on the controlled entities from device page in the [configuration](docs/configuration.md) file.

## Build Information

Image builds can be tracked in this repository's `Actions` tab, and utilize [artifact attestation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds) to certify provenance.

The Docker images are built using GitHub Actions, which provides:

- Automated builds for different architectures
- Artifact attestation for build provenance verification
- Regular updates and maintenance

The documentation for the build process can be found in the [GitHub Actions Workflows](.github/workflow.md) file.

## Development

### System Requirements

**System packages (Linux):**
- libmpv-dev (`sudo apt install libmpv-dev`)
- PulseAudio/PipeWire (`sudo apt install pulseaudio pipewire`)
- ALSA utils (`sudo apt install alsa-utils`)

**Python:**
- Python 3.11+ must be installed on your system (`python3 --version` should show 3.11+)
- On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev`

### VS Code Setup

VS Code development uses a local Python virtual environment (`.venv/`):

1. Open workspace in VS Code
2. Accept Workspace Trust (bottom-left status bar)
3. Install recommended extensions when prompted:
   - `ms-python.python` - Python language support
   - `ms-python.vscode-pylance` - Python language server
   - `kilo.kilocode` - Kilo AI assistant
4. **Terminal** → **New Terminal** (or `` Ctrl+` ``) - Opens integrated terminal (uses .venv when available)
5. Run `./script/setup --dev` to create `.venv` and install dev dependencies
6. VS Code automatically detects `.venv/bin/python` as the Python interpreter

**Available VS Code Tasks:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+B` - Run Setup or Linter
- `Ctrl+Shift+T` - Run Tests
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" - Show all tasks (Setup, Linter, Tests, Run App)

### Code Quality Checks

The project uses the following tools to ensure code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting (88 characters per line, PEP 8 compliant)
- **isort**: Import sorting compatible with Black
- **flake8**: Style and syntax checks
- **pylint**: Code quality checks
- **mypy**: Static type analysis

### Setup

To use the development tools (linting, testing, etc.), you need to install the required dependencies:

```sh
./script/setup --dev
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Linting Commands

#### Run all linting checks

```sh
./script/lint...
```

#### Individual linting commands (with auto-fix support)


| Script                 | Description                              | Auto-fix Available?   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `./script/lint_black`  | Checks Python code formatting with Black | Yes, use`--auto` flag |
| `./script/lint_flake8` | Runs style and syntax checks with flake8 | No                    |
| `./script/lint_isort`  | Checks import sorting with isort         | Yes, use`--auto` flag |
| `./script/lint_mypy`   | Runs static type analysis with mypy      | No                    |
| `./script/lint_pylint` | Runs code quality checks with pylint     | Yes, use`--auto` flag |

#### Examples

Run a specific lint check:

```sh
./script/lint_black
```

Auto-fix formatting issues (Black + isort):

```sh
./script/lint_black --auto
./script/lint_isort --auto
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:
``` sh
./script/tests
```
